User research: Interview Questions
=========================================

## Introduction, 3-5 min

- Quick interviewer intro
- Interviewee background: sex, job title, years at current job
- Interview concerns a new tool that can be used to construct a layout for a news article for phones, tablets and computers
- Objectives: learn about users and use cases
- Merely a UI prototype -- UI elements simply inform what would happen on a real system
- Ask for recording permission -- only used for research

## Reflection, < 30 min

0. What are your initial feelings in general?
  0. What was easy, why?
  0. What was hard, why?

0. Did the tasks make sense in your opinion?

0. What would you want to be able to change besides the position

0. Was it clear enough from the UI that it is *not* WYSIWYG (Finnish "lopputulos näyttää tarkalleen samalta")?
  0. Would it be better to further highlight the fact?

0. Is this an improvement to the current situation?
